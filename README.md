# Abstract Play: Games/AI Server

Version: unnumbered alpha

Nothing to see here yet. This project is in the very early stages. No real documentation yet, but it's coming.

The way to use this is to clone or download the repository, create a virtual env, install the dependencies (see `requirements.txt`), then run.

## Contact

The [main website](https://www.abstractplay.com) houses the development blog, wiki, and first-party front end.

## Change log

20 Apr 2018:

  * Moving things to AWS lambda. Archiving this repository. Now use AbstractPlay/games-aws instead.

13 Jun 2017:

  * I haven't been keeping this up to date. See the [development blog](https://www.abstractplay.com/blog) for details.
  * Updated the virtual env to get the code running again.
  * The server does indeed run and serve as expected.
  * Ithaka is still the only game currently available. I won't implement others until the full workflow (from game creation to archival) is working for this one game. No mean feat!

03 Jun 2016:

  * Initial import.
  * Service *does* start, and my goal is to make sure that every commit will at least run.
