# Abstract Play: Games/AI Server

Version: 0.0.1

Nothing to see here yet. This project is in the very early stages. No real documentation yet, but it's coming.

The way to use this is to clone or download the repository, install the dependencies, then run. The `requirements.txt` file is still broken.

## Change log

03 Jun 2016:

  * Initial import.
  * Service *does* start, and my goal is to make sure that every commit will at least run.
